I am a master’s student at the College of Plant Protection, _[Northwest A&F University](https://www.nwafu.edu.cn/)_, where I also earned my bachelor’s degree in Life Sciences. I further expanded my research skills in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology during a visiting undergraduate at Wuhan University. My current research focuses on (1) phylogenomics and (2) molecular evolution of chemosensory genes in vertebrates and insects.  

Thank you for visiting my page :)
